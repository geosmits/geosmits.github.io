Hello! I am a fifth-year PhD Candidate in Statistics in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Cornell University, advised by Professor [David S. Matteson](https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/david-s-matteson), and with incredible mentorship from my committee members Professor [Sumanta Basu](https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/sumanta-basu) and Professor [Martin T. Wells](https://stat.cornell.edu/people/faculty/martin-wells). My work focuses on developing Bayesian and machine learning methods for complex, noisy time series data.
